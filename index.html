                Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. 
                Some of these include swimming, waterskiing, boating, surfing and diving. 
                In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating, are played on ice. 
                Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. 
                Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water 
                features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other flora and fauna inside aquariums or ponds for 
                show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. skiing, sledding, 
                snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be frozen.
